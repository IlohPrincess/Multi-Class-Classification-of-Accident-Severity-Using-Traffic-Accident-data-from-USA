# Multi-Class-Classification-of-Accident-Severity-Using-Traffic-Accident-data-from-USA
With the upsurge in traffic-related mortality, it is more imperative than ever to find effective solutions. We can determine factors that are influential factors in relation to accident severity with the aid of machine learning. This study made use of the US Accidents dataset from Kaggle. The study presents an ensemble of machine learning models for the prediction of accident severity, including Multinomial Logistics Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Multi-layer Perceptron classifier (MLP) and Random Forest (RF) Classifier.
